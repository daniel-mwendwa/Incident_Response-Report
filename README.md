## 📌 Overview

This lab simulates a real-world incident triggered by suspicious system behavior, reported by a user and escalated to the SOC. We analyze a malicious `.docm` file leading to a C2 connection and persistent process injection.

## 📐 Frameworks Used

| Framework | Phases |
|----------|--------|
| **NIST** | Prep → Detect/Analyze → Contain → Eradicate → Recover → Post-Incident |
| **SANS** | Prep → Identification → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned |

## 🔍 IR Lifecycle Walkthrough

### 🛠️ Preparation
- Setup IR policies and procedures
- Deployed SIEM & EDR tools
- Conducted risk assessment & tabletop exercises

### ⚠️ Detection & Analysis
- Identified high CPU process: `3d33es454e.exe`
- Connection to C2: `45.33.32.156:42424`
- Malicious macro doc: `invoice n. 37484567 (1).docm`
- Analyzed VBA code for behavior

### 🔒 Containment
- Network isolation of infected host
- Process termination via Task Manager
- IOC block via EDR/SIEM rules

### 🧹 Eradication
- Deleted malware and macro file
- Cleaned registry persistence key

### ♻️ Recovery
- Restored clean system image
- Verified system integrity and logs

### 📄 Post-Incident
- Documented steps, IOCs, and lessons
- Updated playbooks and tooling
- Conducted internal IR review
